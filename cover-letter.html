    <p>Dear Mister, Misses</p>
    <p>
      I'm contacting you after reading your job offer for an Angular developer in Dublin city.
      After multiple years in the same company, I feel the need to cope with new professional challenges. 
      Therefore working with js stack technologies for a large company based in Dublin seems perfect for me.</p>
    <p>
      I've been a front end developer for seven years in a Belgian company specialised in e-learning.
      I used to maintain legacy products for three years.
      That gave me a hard lesson of what could become a non standard unrefactored legacy code and the impact on the viability of a business.
      Meanwhile, I was implicated in multiple calls for projects, including OLS+ (erasmus), Wallangues and Brulingua.
     </p>
     <p>
      In 2016, Altissia started off an ambitious plan of modernization.
      Strengh by our internal experiences, my colleagues and me took our responsibilities and provided technical propositions in order to reach the management objectives.
      During three years, we made strikes on the global rethinking and rewriting of the applications with angular2+ for the front end side. 
      We implemented a microservice architecture that has allowed us to maintain efficiently four different applications and ten shared librairies. 
     </p>
     <p>
      In 2019 - 2020, I progressively moved from a feature developer to a new challenging position. 
      My new goal was to focused on decreasing our build time and automate as much as possible the front end workflow based on the technologies previously implemented. 
      More precisely I succeed to reduce up to two times the building times and automate several manual steps of our workflow by using custom NX generators and executors.
      I adapted cypress integration inside our workspace in order to test all components set in application or in shared librarires.
    </p>
    <p>
      I think due to my career expericences be able to suit one of the profile search by this company.
      I admit have less practises with c#. 
      However I have good bases in oriented object development, mvc/mvvm patterns. More than that I used multiple years mono language with unity3D during my free time. 
      I have no doubt to obtain rapidly the expected knowledges and skills for this stack.
    </p>
